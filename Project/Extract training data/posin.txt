Great staff and the food was fantastic!
Great staff and the food was fantastic!
On our way back home to Edmonton from Watrous and just googled best vietnamese restaurant in Saskatoon.  Several restaurants popped out but I  have chosen the one with the most review. So we landed here and it didn't disappoint us. Great food, fast service and affordable. Never mind the many taxes of Saskatoon.
"I didn't expect to find good Vietnamese food in Saskatoon but was pleasantly surprised. Prices here are crazy low with the Justinflation we have to deal with, so $10 noodle bowls are a treat.

I recommend the butter chicken wings, these were thicc n crispy with butter taste that went super well with the onions. Vermicelli was awesome too."

Without a doubt the best noodle bowl and spring rolls I've ever had!

The meal starts off with complimentary tea. The pho tasted authentic due to a strong bone broth flavor. It was not overly salty and the meat was tender. The discount for using cash was a nice incentive. The seating is very limited since the interior of the restaurant is small. Lastly, the staff was prompt and friendly.
"We, all four, had a dinner tonight. We ordered imperial roll, Special Pho, Grilled Shrimp, beef & chicken, crispy noodle with shrimp, sautéed pork with vermicelli. We enjoyed meals a lot.

Staff is friendly too.

Hidden Pho place in Longueuil."
Great customer service - haven't felt this level of hospitality in a while, was refreshing. The food was amazing quality and hefty proportions. Owner recommended the very spicy sauce, try it - incredibly spicy but worth the dip
Really nice little place to go and eat with a bunch of friends or even when you decide to do a solo meal they treat you really nice. Food has amazing taste,nit was fresh and the quantity was enough to fill you completelly!!! Love this place, I normally do take out but after today I might just do the 5min drive to have a cozy meal.
"This place was so good, we came here twice during our 2-days stay in the area! The food was just delicious.
The place itself was a little dark, but that didn't really bother us. The personal was friendly and helpful."

Delighted to discover this gem in Gatineau! There are a lot of options and the food is pretty affordable. I'm so used to paying so much for restaurants, but the food here while delicious, will not break your wallet. Will be back for sure!
We stayed overnight in Sherbrooke on the way from Boston to Quebec. We found this restaurant, thanks to this site, and went there with the kids . The service was excellent, the food was excellent. The waitress overheard us speaking in English and asked us if we wanted a menu in English. Very friendly. We all speak French, which helped a lot.
"I love the space in here, ambient sound, service great, clean, their uniform looks professional.

The food is good (8/10). Recommend: Wonton fries, Boeuf de bétel grillé, soup yum, wonton soup, chicken beef shrimp grill rice."

A very nice addition to NDG’s eastern area. Right next to Decarie. Le, the chef and owner is delightful. The food is excellent, fresh and flavourful. We live close and you can expect us back for more photos soon!
"Great Vietnamese food. Portion are on the small side.
There was a funny odor entering the restaurant but did not affect the experience at the end."

Do yourself a favor and order #16. unless you're allergic to peanuts, in which case they have many other options that are just about as good. Staff is always friendly and never had an issue with takeout.

Delicious food great prices and friendly services!!

My family and I enjoyed delicious meals.  The General Tao chicken was tasty. Their side wonton soup was slightly salty. The spring rolls were delicious. We also enjoyed fried banana dessert which reminded me of a familiar taste growing up. Overall, the lady who served us, who I am assuming is also the owner, was so sweet.

This place is bright and clean.  The staff were friendly and service was quick despite it being a busy lunch hour.  Our dishes were made with fresh ingredients and serving sizes did not disappoint.  I did find the flavours of the dishes not as pronounced as I'm used to, however this is a personal preference so I didn't ding them for any of the well deserved stars.  Will go back.
"My partner and I have just recently moved to PEI from Toronto and the hardest thing to leave behind was the variety of cuisines. He is Vietnamese and we thought there's no chance of finding food as good as his mum's cooking near our new home.
WE WERE SO WRONG. This place is incredible!! We've been there three times this week! Their ice coffee gives me memories of our time in Vietnam, and the Phở is so delicious, I think about it long after the meal is over!
The owner gives excellent service, and he's so kind! His wife is the incredible chef behind the menu; she really has an incredible pallet, every flavour has so much depth. Service is a little longer, because she's the only one in the kitchen, but well worth the wait (definitely recommend getting an ice coffee to enjoy the wait).
Our new favourite in town! Can't wait to go back!

If you haven't had Vietnamese before, please try this restaurant!! You won't regret the experience!"
"A MUST VISIT!

My family and I passed this restaurant driving through Swift Current during a road trip and decided to try it out. The service was amazing and the food tasted great…. that we decided to go back a second time on our way back home. We will definitely stop by again the next time we pass through Swift Current!"
New look in 2023 with same food quality and good price

"Super welcoming staff even though we didn’t have a reservation. The food was delicious! The chicken broth soup with veggies had a little sweetness but in a good way. The tofu vermicelli  meal was so tasty.
I would recommend a reservation and bringing your own beer or wine."
The best Pho I’ve ever had! No contest at all! The broth is SO good. Great conversations were had with the staff as well. You’re doing a disservice to yourself by not eating this food
This place is absolutely amazing. A true gem! Service was great and food was so fresh. Loved it!
The best tumyum in town. Authentic, fresh, and delicious Vietnamese cuisine. Thank you for bringing such delicious food to Trois-Rivières.
Arguably one of the best Authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Southwestern Ontario, if not, the best in the Golden Horseshoe Area. Their food prices are very reasonable and fair, and are great value for the portion sizes. I would highly recommend this Authentic Vietnamese Restaurant to anybody who visits Niagara Falls. I will be back over and over again many times as long as they don’t change a thing.
This place is absolutely amazing. A true gem! Service was great and food was so fresh. Loved it!
"Wow. This place is so beautiful!!! I loved the decor; every feature was tasteful and delicate and did not distract from the food. The ambiance was lovely and romantic, with fresh flowers on every table. Absolutely gorgeous.

The food is just as incredible. I love great Vietnamese take out, but this dining experience really takes the cake. The duck fresh rolls are to die for! Each roll is sliced into bite sized pieces for easier eating, each one packed with flavour. We got a soothing pot of green tea, shaking beef, mussels with curry, and sweet rice sticks. Everything was so delicious and packed with flavour. The most elevated Vietnamese dining I’ve ever had!"
The food is excellent, the place is small but cozy and you can bring your own wine and beer. Service is always fast and courteous.

"Loved our dinner! Came to Montreal for the weekend and were happy to find this place, since we love pho and they offer vegetarian broth 🌱 the soup was delicious! Portions are generous, prices are fair, the atmosphere is nice and cozy. Definitely recommend 👍🏻
Thank you Pho Long Phung 🙏🏻"

Really great expérience, cosy atmosphère, ample choices, good portion size ans excellent présentation...will visite frequently...offers takeout too...
In town for the weekend! Yum. So fresh and flavorful. Will return! Vietnamese Combo 1 with vermicelli,  chicken fried rice... terrific.  Even the chicken balls were huge and great. Thanks
Exceptionally kind service, and very friendly. Food came very quick. Fresh ingredients, great quality and very tasty. Best pho around!

Excellent grilled chicken and shrimps ! Best nems ever ! Very tasty pad thai ! Very clean. Renewed.  Good pricee ! Very friendly staff
This quickly became one of my favourite restaurants in Little Italy. The pork and beef buns are SO good.
One of very good Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. The place is clean, new, the owner and staff is nice. Waiting time for food is reasonable. It’s pricey compare to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants but acceptable since the quality is there. This is a good place for friends and family. You can pay by credit cards.
Hearty Vietnamese food, perfect for cold winter months! Soupe Tonkinoise was our favourite.
"We went to Olive Et Basil for New Year's Eve supper and the staff was very nice and very quick with taking our orders, bringing our drinks and then bringing our food !
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really romantic and we would absolutely recommend!"

A great experience with family: the place is by the water, the view and the food are marvelous; a unique Thai experience.



We recently went there for lunch. The pho I ordered was rich and flavourful, and the grilled meat with rice my friend order was delicious. The portions were generous and the service was friendly. The cozy, and authentic atmosphere made for a great dining experience. Highly recommend!
Got the general Tao chicken and it was amazing! One of the best I’ve had will definitely be back here !


Amazing experience!! Very dish and drink was yummyyyy... Staff was so cooperative and vigilent all the time.
I am a vegetarian and I have been eating here 2-4 times per month for over a decade. Simply put, this is my favourite restaurant in Drummondville. The food is great and the service is very friendly. I recommend the meal-sized tofu and fried noodle soup. I have a bowl on every visit and it is always delicious.
This place is good and cheap for the full course menu that they give. In the beginnung they will serve you chicken soup with noodles in a small bowl. And then continued with 2 small spring rolls. And they you can choose the main course that you like. I tried the lemongrass beef with vermicelli. It was really great. The porsion is not too much but it was fulfilling for me. And that at then you can continue with tea or coffee plus 1 slice of cake. At that time it was Elizabeth cake. I recommend this place to have full course of a good meal.
I love this place! Food taste good and fresh. Love their tom yum soup aux crevettes! Definitely recommend it

"I had a really great time at this place, honestly.

It was a huge shock to see a restaurant with traditional Vietnamian meals. My friend took the jelly-fish salad, which definitely was a culinary experience.

The meal are made to be eaten just like in Vietnam, with the waiter even explaining how to eat it, making it feel like a cultural experience at the same time, too.

Everything I ate was great, I just regret playing it safe and only taking a soup compared to my friends. I'm definitely looking forward to going there again, just for the great food and service there.

It was a joy to eat there."

The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.

My go to Vietnamese place. Been going to it since it opened and it’s always amazing! My favourite items on the menu are the rare beef pho and the spring rolls. The ingredients are super fresh and the broths have nice rich flavours. I’d you want delicious Vietnamese food this is your place!
The food was very tasty. Not too much Québécois Viet-Thai food, haha... I'll definitely go back this place when I visit again!
Great vietnamese food. Great ambiance and it’s a BYOW! We were with group of friends and it was great! Order the chicken wings and the curry, the crispy noodles.

We were craving Vietnamese food and did not want to go to Montreal. We found this place online and decided to give it a try. The food was delicious, fresh and authentic, and not expensive. It has become our new place! Definitely recommend Tom Yam soup, it's spicy with a medium citrus hint, delicious.

Nice place with great service, and delicious food. Loved the Grill Chicken Cà RI with crispy noodles. Perfect and just right
I recently dined at Pho Vietnam restaurant and was blown away by the delicious food and friendly service. The restaurant itself is cozy and inviting, with a laid-back atmosphere. The menu features a wide variety of tasty dishes, and I particularly enjoyed the vermicelli with grilled pork. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the grilled pork was juicy and flavorful. The service was top-notch, with the waitstaff being attentive and helpful. Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience at Pho Vietnam restaurant and would highly recommend it to others.

Bun Viet is well-known for their “Bún mắm” (I will call it Spicy seafood soup) this is my favorite. It might be too spicy for who can’t handle the heat, so make sure to check with the owner/chef. This new place is cute, clean and tidy. I always call in advance for pick up since this place quite busy, so prepare for the wait if you just walk-in. Generous portion and the soup always good. Bonus, I often order extra “Chả mực” to go (see picture attached), you can freeze and eat them later.
Best banh mi sandwich I've had in a long time. It was fresh, bread was crunchy. Strongly suggest this place for a quick bite. Can't wait to go try the Pho. Owner is very friendly and offers A1 service.
"One of my favorites for Bun Bo Hue.

Thinks it's only served on Saturdays/weekends, $15 for a regular bowl

The broth is nicely flavored. You have bits if lemongrass satay floating around. Different types of meat with a nicely peppered viet ham. Even got a piece of pork hock gnaw at. Comes with bean sprouts, cabbage and the proper vegetables (minus banana heart). Not overly spicy where you're non stop sweating, just the right amount

The noodles were a bit overcooked

Quick, friendly staff that also comes with cold tea. Would recommend!"
We have been coming here for at least the past year after our discovery! The food and service is consistent. Always very good and fresh! We love the pho, the combo rice plates and today, I even tried the bubble tea which was actually pretty good! Their prices are very good compared to other restaurants in the city and the food is better here!

Good Vietnameese Coffee, awesome Soups!!!! Great prices/quality ratio and it was not crowded so we could seat and eat with à great ambiance. Will def visit again <3"

Cheaper than most Vietnamese places around town."

"Great Vietnamese restaurant! We tried the Papaya salad, grilled squid, soft-shell crab, the chef choice for the skewers and the fried banana dessert. Everything was delicious and not pricey. The decor and the service were great.

I recommend this restaurant. I will be coming back to try more dishes."
The best! I always Uber and pick up from here. Always so fresh, the tempura shrimp as the best that I’ve ever had. 10/10 recommend.

"Had the Pho. Quality was superb, well exceeding the price(at time of writing). Sadly, the service was slow. Pho shouldn't take 10+ minutes to serve, even at an off-peak hour. Still going to recommend this, because the Pho is just THAT good: meat is fresh, portion sizes are great, and the broth just tastes amazing and authentic. 1 minor negative- probably just me though -  the waiter forgot my Iced tea. It's probably just a one off though.

EDIT: Returned, and the food is as good as ever, tendon was not the freshest, yet still fresh enough to be served. All other elements of the pho is on point. Service is faster now. Revised review, 4.5/5, -0.5 stars for the barely fresh tendon."

One of my favorite asian cuisine restaurants and it's located in the hometown where I grew up by the boardwalk. I have went there to eat a few times and had a wonderful experience each time 😊 The staff (and by that I mean ALL of the staff) is extremely welcoming and friendly. The food is simply DELICIOUS! 🤤 The won ton soup and dumplings are my personal top picks from their menu 💕 I also tried the general Tao chicken which I loved 😍 (the chicken is actually in sauce that you can dip and soak it in which makes it amazing compared to others I have tried which are more dry). I highly recommend ❤

"I was in the mood for a great pho and stumbled upon this restaurant after a day of shopping. I ordered there house pho luckily the server told me that it came in a huge bowl
. So I had the large instead of the XL. Great tasting pho, and I also ordered the shrimp salad. Food came quickly about 5 minutes after ordering."

The Chicken Pho was delicious, so big I took half home. The service was great the girls called me by name and we're very nice. A bit dull inside with all the gray walls and the carpeting should be removed soon.
Authentic Khmer food at a very reasonable price. The taste is there just like home.  We give the order and can eat inside or we can takeout.
Great fast food style restaurant. The banh mi is tasty and quite large. I usually get a soup too, their new pho style one is great and tasty

This place is absolutely amazing. A true gem! Service was great and food was so fresh. Loved it!
"Great Vietnamese restaurant! We tried the Papaya salad, grilled squid, soft-shell crab, the chef choice for the skewers and the fried banana dessert. Everything was delicious and not pricey. The decor and the service were great.

I recommend this restaurant. I will be coming back to try more dishes."

Delighted to discover this gem in Gatineau! There are a lot of options and the food is pretty affordable. I'm so used to paying so much for restaurants, but the food here while delicious, will not break your wallet. Will be back for sure!
Great staff and the food was fantastic!
"I would give a 4.5 if there was one, but def deserves more than a 4 so I gave a 5!

Unexpected from this old neighborhood strip mall, quite good and priced very reasonably.
Cheaper than most Vietnamese places around town."
"A taste of downtown Montreal at our doorstep.
What a great restaurant. We moved from NDG close by a couple years ago and one of the things we missed was fine dining, great service at Normal prices.

We came here for both lunch and dinner. Fantastic perfectly done dinner with exceptional service. You’d expect to pay a lot more for what you get.

Don’t think twice and if you go, say HI to Jimmy for us! He’s the gentleman who will likely be your waiter and will likely become your friend in no time.

5 star service and 5 star food."

"Had the combo set, which include the nouilles croustillantes (fried noodles) that came with a fried spring roll and a little pho.

The soup was rich and the sauce for the fried noodles tasty.

Friendly people too."

Quaint little restaurant. Home-made, delicious foods, takes me right back to Chile. Great customer service, friendly family-run restaraunt. I have been coming here for over 20 years. We travel from out of town and have no need to go anywhere else. I always order the Bistec a lo pobre. Delicioso!
The best Pho I’ve ever had! No contest at all! The broth is SO good. Great conversations were had with the staff as well. You’re doing a disservice to yourself by not eating this food
"Very clean, very pretty. The staff were nice and it was quiet. Food came quick and it was delicious. Good prices and the bathroom was clean and well kept. Will definitely come back❤️
(Ps: there was a big fish, very friendly and will “chase” you :] 🐠)"

In town for the weekend! Yum. So fresh and flavorful. Will return! Vietnamese Combo 1 with vermicelli,  chicken fried rice... terrific.  Even the chicken balls were huge and great. Thanks
Awesome neighbourhood gem. Friendly service. Great soups. Lunch express special is great value.  Big portions. Mango salad is delicious. Outdoor patios in warm months.  Busy with a local crowd. Some limited vegetarian options, would love it if their fried spring roll or imperial roll came in a vegetarian version. The kitchen knows exactly how to fulfill your Vietnamese cravings!
The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.
Amazing food. I ordered grilled Satay chicken and came so quick. Portion size was generous for the price. It was my first time and definitely coming back
I loved this restaurant! If you love pho 🍜 , I highly suggest you come here! The staff was friendly and attentive. The restaurant is family owned and they have been here for 30 years, standing the test of time because of their amazing hospitality and food quality. The chicken pho 🍜 was rich and hot, with a touch of sweetness. We ordered their special chicken fried rice which was amazing, it was nice and crisp. The spring rolls were crispy and scrumptious. Our summer rolls had a fresh and clean touch to it. The Vietnamese coffee ☕️ was awesome 🤩 it had a great punch to it, just what you need to get a good start to your day. Overall I would rate this restaurant a 10 out of 10 .
Authentic Vietnamese food. It was soooo good. A little gem of a place in rural Saskatchewan.  Worth the drive to have a great meal.
This restaurant’s a hidden gem in Humboldt. We ordered the Combo Number 1 for $10.95! Our order came with rice, Chow Mein noodles, deep fried shrimp and sweet and sour ribs. The prices were very affordable. We were well taken care of during our visit and the food was delicious!

The food was very tasty. Not too much Québécois Viet-Thai food, haha... I'll definitely go back this place when I visit again!
"What an amazing experience, the food the decor the staff everything was perfect!

Also the generous quantities, here is a story; We took the gastronomique 1 pour deux. After the main course, we thought we where done, almost full just enough place for the dessert, but nooo... BOOM they drop another plate full of goodness on the table... Believe me, You Will Eat It All, because its simply too good!

As a dessert i strongly recommend one of the begniet ( fresh fried doughnuts with a slice of fresh fruit in side) its freaking amazing.

Best place for a nice romantic dinner or share a plate with a good friend!"
We ordered one tom yum soup with noodles and one vegetarian tom yum soup with no noodles. They were absolutely delicious, right amount of spice, great vegetable selection. The service was great and the staff were all friendly. Will definitely be returning for more.
"Super welcoming staff even though we didn’t have a reservation. The food was delicious! The chicken broth soup with veggies had a little sweetness but in a good way. The tofu vermicelli  meal was so tasty.
I would recommend a reservation and bringing your own beer or wine."
I was so surprised by the dishes that they offered here! It’s really hard to come by a Vietnamese place that doesn’t just serve your typical pho and other noodle soup dishes. Their menu is so exciting and the flavours are so authentic! I absolutely loved the fish sauce chicken wings and the pork belly skewers!! The sauce that comes with the pork belly skewer, mam tom, is not usually found in restaurants, as it has a very pungent taste. Most of the time you have to ask for it and you’ll only get it if they even have any. They did dilute it a bit here but non the less, I was very excited that they had it! The pho was flavourful and very rich. I would definitely return and would recommend it to anyone looking for authentic Vietnamese street food!

Great service the server was super nice and polite. The food was great and great portions too! Definitely would recommend and come again.
New Year's Eve 2022.  Ordered chicken pho and pork spring rolls.  Friend ordered bun with spring roll and sausage on a bed of rice noodles.  Everything was hot and delicious.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Pho Quinn never disappoints - a great neighborhood restaurant!
Simply amazing!  We are from out of town and found this place on google so decided to try… let me tell you we were so impressed!  The peanut sauce for the fresh rolls was great, the Cambodian rice was fantastic, the Bangkok soup out of this world…. I could go on and on but you get the idea!  When we return to Quebec we will definitely stop by for another meal!

Fast take out service 15 min. The food was a-ma-zing. Chicken and pork melts in your mouth, beef was a little over cooked but the seasoning and sauces really put everything together. Good portions for the price.

The best tumyum in town. Authentic, fresh, and delicious Vietnamese cuisine. Thank you for bringing such delicious food to Trois-Rivières.
Incredible Vietnamese restaurant! It is truly a hidden gem in Meadow Lake since there aren't that many options around. We ordered a Pho beef balls, Beef and Chicken Salad Rolls. Our food was quick and super fresh! The waiters were extremely friendly and attentive and helpful with the menu. Great portion and quality is top notch!! I'd highly recommend the Pho Special. Their pho is quite flavourful and authentic especially the broth! As A Vietnamese, I am confident that their food is authentic as I've gone to several Vietnamese restaurants in Saskatoon but this one reminds me the taste of home!
"Loved our dinner! Came to Montreal for the weekend and were happy to find this place, since we love pho and they offer vegetarian broth 🌱 the soup was delicious! Portions are generous, prices are fair, the atmosphere is nice and cozy. Definitely recommend 👍🏻
Thank you Pho Long Phung 🙏🏻"

Exceptionally kind service, and very friendly. Food came very quick. Fresh ingredients, great quality and very tasty. Best pho around!
Went in for a quick food to go. I have always loved Crispy chicken. Just the way they marinade their chickens and also the rice are so good  This particular location is small but well maintained. The lady was friendly despite being busy with all her tasks. Food wait time is somewhat fair. My orders have always been correct so no complaint on that. We’ll definitely come back for sure.
Great fast food style restaurant. The banh mi is tasty and quite large. I usually get a soup too, their new pho style one is great and tasty
"The owner is super nice and generous!
The portions are also generous and really good
I would go back for aure 😋💯💯💯"
The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.
Picked up a couple of veggie imperial roll banh mis and veggie bun bo (without the beef) hue. Both were sooooo full of flavour, and probs were ample. The service from the family who ran this place were so warm and friendly. I have another veggie (no roll) banh mi to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. This will be a regular joint when I make my way to the Plateau again...please keep it afloat, locals!
Best banh mi sandwich I've had in a long time. It was fresh, bread was crunchy. Strongly suggest this place for a quick bite. Can't wait to go try the Pho. Owner is very friendly and offers A1 service.
"My partner and I have just recently moved to PEI from Toronto and the hardest thing to leave behind was the variety of cuisines. He is Vietnamese and we thought there's no chance of finding food as good as his mum's cooking near our new home.
WE WERE SO WRONG. This place is incredible!! We've been there three times this week! Their ice coffee gives me memories of our time in Vietnam, and the Phở is so delicious, I think about it long after the meal is over!
The owner gives excellent service, and he's so kind! His wife is the incredible chef behind the menu; she really has an incredible pallet, every flavour has so much depth. Service is a little longer, because she's the only one in the kitchen, but well worth the wait (definitely recommend getting an ice coffee to enjoy the wait).
Our new favourite in town! Can't wait to go back!

If you haven't had Vietnamese before, please try this restaurant!! You won't regret the experience!"
Great pho broth. The grills are excellents. They're using quality ingredients and the price is quite good. Fast service with friendly staffs. The restaurant have such a nice decor. Great ambiance with a modern touch.
Nice place with great service, and delicious food. Loved the Grill Chicken Cà RI with crispy noodles. Perfect and just right
Nice family run business. Great food.
The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.
A very nice addition to NDG’s eastern area. Right next to Decarie. Le, the chef and owner is delightful. The food is excellent, fresh and flavourful. We live close and you can expect us back for more photos soon!
Great vietnamese food. Great ambiance and it’s a BYOW! We were with group of friends and it was great! Order the chicken wings and the curry, the crispy noodles.
Great food. Even my dear Vietnamese wife had nothing bad too say about this restaurant. Great service amazing food.

This place never fails to deliver! Food is always served fresh. This is our go-to place when we're craving for something Asian. We love the dinner for one with ginger beef!

Great unpretentious Viet place wow. Jot down your order on the paper and submit! Huge selection, many dishes! Over 500 choices. Quick and kind service, was super impressed on how staff deal with the rush appropriately and food came quick and hot. Would solid recommend this restaurant and will be back again.
If only I could give this place more than 5 stars!!! Quan Ngon is absolutely amazing in every way!! Their pho is next level delicious and so totally addicting! The family who runs the restaurant is super friendly! You're always eating within 10 minutes and the value is insane! $16 for a combo and you will leave FULL! There are weeks where I come twice because once a week is not enough!
"I enjoyed the dine in, was pleasant and a little old. But I can see the new owners are trying and are sincere. Two people doing all that work, I am happy with the hard work those two provide, and still have the chance to smile and communicate. The price is a bit up there but not by much, compared to the former owners a few years ago. Their young boy spoke English well. But the owners didnt. This two current owners are doing well, Id say. Ive seen how fast, how hard they work to get my food to me. And even have the time to check my order, to make sure it was all there. I ordered a bubble tea with my order, and it was a bit less than usual, but the gentleman at the front took off a $1.50 and said they couldnt make more atm because of how busy they were. (All tables full, and 8-10 order papers hanging) So I understand, but it is thoughtful he gave me what I pay for. And they said theres going to be renovations happening soon, so I look forward to seeing the new look. Hopefully new food. But speaking of new food, that Spicy Lemon Shrimp, its worth it, 10 pieces of shrimp and rice with veggies. I dont know what is in it but its delicious. I received one of these when I seen the announcement on Facebook, and it looked great, tasted even better.

I am happy that the deep fried rolls have more meat in it(my favourite) what others say about little meat are just picky. Ive seen the older rolls and it looked waaaay less. These ones are thicker, and its a different type of  rolls. This has no veggies because not an egg roll from what I gather, as egg rolls have all that tasty goodness of veggies and a bit of everything. These however do not, but I lovem. My Child lovesem and eats 8.  Sauce is less salty So Im pleased with that, the owners before made the fish sauce so salty.

all in all. I just love this restaurant, and looking forward to coming here when its fixed up more, and get reliable staff. Its always those two just working and theyre doing an awesome job.
Especially since the last owners spoke little english, except their son who spoke very well. I can always get my order across without miscommunication.
Whenever I order on the phone they ask for my name and number if they dont have it, sadly I had private name private number and when I picked up my food was a little on the cooler side but thats my fault. As the gentleman said 15-20 min for one of my orders. But I got side tracked and picked up an hour later. He couldnt phone it was P.N .

All in all. I love it

I just wish more variety of their bubble tea, that would be nice. But most of their products are imported sadly…"
Bic, os one of the nicest persons in the food industry...she is always willing g to take time to stop and  hat with you, no matter how busy the restaurant is..very nice building and the interior decor is a little out dated but always so clean.
My go to Vietnamese place. Been going to it since it opened and it’s always amazing! My favourite items on the menu are the rare beef pho and the spring rolls. The ingredients are super fresh and the broths have nice rich flavours. I’d you want delicious Vietnamese food this is your place!
I ordered a spicy chicken pad Thai for lunch. The restaurant is clean. The staff were friendly. The food was prepared quickly and was served hot. I was impressed by the full flavour and excellent quality ingredients. The serving size was large and plenty for one. You could definitely share a pad Thai with someone. This isn't the best pad Thai I've had but it deserves 5 stars nonetheless. I will be back to try the pho.

Got a delicious salmon poke bowl. Large portions and fresh ingredients. I love their spicy mayo sauce and all the toppings flavours come together harmoniously. Fast and friendly service, it’s perfect to grab for dinner after work when you’re too busy to cook.
"The food is always soo good 🤤I can not relate to the bad reviews , this place is great . Always content , plus it’s a lot cheaper than a lot of other pho places that I find weren’t as great . Great food and price
I never have left a review in my life but seeing all the negative reviews here is surprising , always give something a try for yourself before believing other people opinions"
Delighted to discover this gem in Gatineau! There are a lot of options and the food is pretty affordable. I'm so used to paying so much for restaurants, but the food here while delicious, will not break your wallet. Will be back for sure!

You can still go into their parking through the construction !"

Some of the best Vietnamese food in town. I only wish they added their 2023 Poutine Week special to the regular menu.

Great service, fast and good Sushi
"I have not been to this restaurant in years as I moved from MTL to TOR. I was down for the weekend and stopped by, unfortunately they weren't opened yet but I had the pleasure of speaking to the lady that worked there, I let her know that I would ALWAYS eat here as a kid growing up and LOVED the food and that I came down from Toronto and she was ready to prep me up some food right then and there despite being closed! I will ALWAYS share this restaurant with my family & friends as not only is the food great but the staff is the BEST!

Thank you for staying Genuine"

This place is absolutely amazing. A true gem! Service was great and food was so fresh. Loved it!
The broth at The Pho Restaurant is very flavourful and hits the spot on a chilly day. This is my first time back to the restaurant after they moved locations and it’s just as good as I remember it. The staff are attentive and helpful. The free tea was also really good, it tasted and smelled like tapioca. I waited about 60 minutes using the Yelp Wait List and was surprised by how many people were waiting on a Sunday night, right before close. Ordering at the restaurant is also done via scanning a QR code and ordering online. Overall, great restaurant with great food.

I took 3 appetizers :
- Imperial rolls
- Small Pho
- Honey Garlic Chicken skewers.
Guys I am not kidding, it's really really good! I am really picky when it comes to finding a good pho place and I think I found it! The food is high quality, well seasoned and came out fast. The presentation is cute and the prices are perfect. I'm already looking forward to my next meal here."

"very nice byo restaurant with above average cuisine.
lots of fresh vegis and great soups.
very friendly and warm ambiance."
Arguably one of the best Authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Southwestern Ontario, if not, the best in the Golden Horseshoe Area. Their food prices are very reasonable and fair, and are great value for the portion sizes. I would highly recommend this Authentic Vietnamese Restaurant to anybody who visits Niagara Falls. I will be back over and over again many times as long as they don’t change a thing.

I think this restaurant is a local gem. I went there today for the first time because I had heard they have great gluten free meals. I loved the warm inviting atmosphere, had a good experience with the staff, and thoroughly enjoyed my shrimp vermicelli bowl! I can see why my friend recommended it. I'm definitely going back!
An absolutely fantastic experience. The food is incredible and the service was excellent. They definitely have a new client in us. I recommend to everyone to try this place 😊👍

The food was like nothing I’ve ever had before. The flavours are so good!! I tried 3 different dishes over a week and it was all delicious. I couldn’t get over how good their soup broth/flavour is. Price is also very reasonable.

"Very good food, I'll definitely be going back.
*Edit: This food is simply the best. Don't hesitate, you won't regret it."

We went for the first time there and it was delicious. The staff is super friendly . Iam very happy to have discovered this place. Will return for sure.
"It's 2023, and you only have 11.50$ in your pocket. You can either buy 1 pint at [trendy bar of the moment], or 2 banh mis + a Coke at Nha Trang. Which do you choose?

Prices are incredible, bread is fresh, portions decent. Careful with those chili peppers though!"
We recently went there for lunch. The pho I ordered was rich and flavourful, and the grilled meat with rice my friend order was delicious. The portions were generous and the service was friendly. The cozy, and authentic atmosphere made for a great dining experience. Highly recommend!
One of very good Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. The place is clean, new, the owner and staff is nice. Waiting time for food is reasonable. It’s pricey compare to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants but acceptable since the quality is there. This is a good place for friends and family. You can pay by credit cards.

Got takeout today, and it was delicious - just like every time I've eaten at the PSC location or Atwater market. The bun cha, veggie spring rolls, General Sao chicken - all perfect, everything fresh, well cooked, and good portions. Can't wait to go back for the yummy pho and banh mi!
The best! I always Uber and pick up from here. Always so fresh, the tempura shrimp as the best that I’ve ever had. 10/10 recommend.

The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.
"Great place for food. I come here often and I love their menu selection. They are also great at helping through the menu and making exceptions for vegetarians. I will always come here for awesome Vietnamese food.

My favorite dish is their birds nest. The sauce is delicious and they really serve it nicely. They are also incredibly quick at getting orders out. You're never sitting hungry for too long!"

Nice local Asian food stop. Very good food, busy even on a Wednesday and very good prices. Best we have tried in Prince Albert so far !
"Delicious !

The most delicious Vietnamese food I've tried in PEI."
Great restaurant. Always been there with my family and it’s always a comfort food. To est cheaper, go there for lunch, but the prices are pretty reasonable. I 100% recommend.

This place is good and cheap for the full course menu that they give. In the beginnung they will serve you chicken soup with noodles in a small bowl. And then continued with 2 small spring rolls. And they you can choose the main course that you like. I tried the lemongrass beef with vermicelli. It was really great. The porsion is not too much but it was fulfilling for me. And that at then you can continue with tea or coffee plus 1 slice of cake. At that time it was Elizabeth cake. I recommend this place to have full course of a good meal.

Wonderfully spiced food, and delightful service.  We went with three kids, and they managed to thrill (literally) all three with a spectrum of spicy and less so food for various pallets (and ages).  The Lemongrass frogs legs are well worth sampling, but it was all excellent.

BBQ Pork had a great char to it and tasted wonderful over rice. Special Pho was also much better than expected and the portion was generous. Viet Iced Coffee was a bit too sweet because of too much condensed milk but other than that absolutely zero complaints!
"Wow. This place is so beautiful!!! I loved the decor; every feature was tasteful and delicate and did not distract from the food. The ambiance was lovely and romantic, with fresh flowers on every table. Absolutely gorgeous.

The food is just as incredible. I love great Vietnamese take out, but this dining experience really takes the cake. The duck fresh rolls are to die for! Each roll is sliced into bite sized pieces for easier eating, each one packed with flavour. We got a soothing pot of green tea, shaking beef, mussels with curry, and sweet rice sticks. Everything was so delicious and packed with flavour. The most elevated Vietnamese dining I’ve ever had!"

"What a Big SHOUT OUT TO REGINA PHO !

I recently dined at a fantastic restaurant called "" Regina Pho"" and I have to say, I was blown away by the entire experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly by the staff and the atmosphere was welcoming and inviting.

The service was outstanding from start to finish, with attentive waiter who were knowledgeable about the menu and happy to offer recommendations.

But the real star of the show was the food. Everything we ordered was simply outstanding. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. I particularly loved the way they made Vietnamese  Beef Noodles(called Pho), my wife was a big fan of Fresh Spring Rolls  with delicious dipping sauce and 2 kids really enjoyed their Pork Chop Rice with 2 eggs on top and Crunchy Fried Chicken Taco. The portion sizes were generous, and the price was reasonable for the quality of the food and service.

Overall, I can't recommend this restaurant enough. It's clear that the chefs and staff take pride in what they do, and their attention to detail and commitment to excellence really shines through. If you're looking for a wonderful dining experience, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

P/s: Definitely, we will keep coming back if we have a chance to travel to Regina from Moose Jaw."
Great food for great value. I had visited multiple times, and each time did not disappoint. The pho was tasty. I had been looking for rice rolls and this may be the only restaurant in Regina that serves them! Staff were very friendly. Definitely worth a visit.

If only I could give this place more than 5 stars!!! Quan Ngon is absolutely amazing in every way!! Their pho is next level delicious and so totally addicting! The family who runs the restaurant is super friendly! You're always eating within 10 minutes and the value is insane! $16 for a combo and you will leave FULL! There are weeks where I come twice because once a week is not enough!

In town for the weekend! Yum. So fresh and flavorful. Will return! Vietnamese Combo 1 with vermicelli,  chicken fried rice... terrific.  Even the chicken balls were huge and great. Thanks

Excellent! Whenever you wanna eat good food in peace, it's your go to place.
"Wow such a positive big change and improvement from the last restaurant/owner.
At first, I hesitate to try Pho Fleury because I had a really bad experience with the previous pho restaurant in the same place.
I placed an order on the phone and the lady was so nice and friendly! Everything was done quickly and the food was really good!
I took the Pho Dac Biet and the Grilled Beef and everything was tasty, well presented and still hot when I got home.

Try them out! You won't regret it :)"

Take out only, but some fantastic beef pho. Broth was delicious and that's the key to good pho. Vegetable rolls and tom yum were very good too. Good prices.

I ordered a spicy chicken pad Thai for lunch. The restaurant is clean. The staff were friendly. The food was prepared quickly and was served hot. I was impressed by the full flavour and excellent quality ingredients. The serving size was large and plenty for one. You could definitely share a pad Thai with someone. This isn't the best pad Thai I've had but it deserves 5 stars nonetheless. I will be back to try the pho.
Great pho broth. The grills are excellents. They're using quality ingredients and the price is quite good. Fast service with friendly staffs. The restaurant have such a nice decor. Great ambiance with a modern touch.

What I liked the most is that lady that served us was very kind and carring with our requests and orders. Family like atmoshpere was surprisingly very comfortable. Plates are big enough to not feeling hungry after and prices were okey. Jasmin tea was just perfect ending, thank you very much.

The food was very tasty. Not too much Québécois Viet-Thai food, haha... I'll definitely go back this place when I visit again!
"Wow I'm amazed at how good the food is! The staffs are so friendly and the restaurant is really well designed.

I took 3 appetizers :
- Imperial rolls
- Small Pho
- Honey Garlic Chicken skewers.
Guys I am not kidding, it's really really good! I am really picky when it comes to finding a good pho place and I think I found it! The food is high quality, well seasoned and came out fast. The presentation is cute and the prices are perfect. I'm already looking forward to my next meal here."
A lil expensive for a chicken pad thai but the portions are good and everything we ordered was delicious (wonton soup, lemongrass chicken and beef, pad thai, katsu chicken and fried calamari). It was our first time ordering from this place and I think it just became our go to place for vietnamese food in Laval

"Great Vietnamese restaurant! We tried the Papaya salad, grilled squid, soft-shell crab, the chef choice for the skewers and the fried banana dessert. Everything was delicious and not pricey. The decor and the service were great.

I recommend this restaurant. I will be coming back to try more dishes."
Fast take out service 15 min. The food was a-ma-zing. Chicken and pork melts in your mouth, beef was a little over cooked but the seasoning and sauces really put everything together. Good portions for the price.

Great food, amazing views of St Lawrence, beautiful sunset on the terrace, would definitely return.
Delicious spot to come across if you're in the area! The dish I ordered was 205 (less spicy) and the rice was the chicken fried rice with shrimp, vegetables. Both were delicious and they are quick to bring the food! Prices are great for the portions. I ordered a medium and it was huge! This is a dine-in as well as take out. So it's nice to be able to sit down and enjoy the food. Washrooms are clean which is a plus I'd say! They also give nice hot green tea as soon as you sit. It felt so cozy.
A busy restaurant. Went there at 5:30pm, a lady served me with a bottle of water. She was so busy doing that she only came to take my order 15 minutes after. Ordered a small pho special soup, thankfully my soup came immediately in less than 3 minutes. The small one the portion is really small. Just a dollar more can upgrade for larger soup, if you are hungry, do consider ordering larger options. The pho was awesome! The spicy soup only available in the weekend.

"A taste of downtown Montreal at our doorstep.
What a great restaurant. We moved from NDG close by a couple years ago and one of the things we missed was fine dining, great service at Normal prices.

We came here for both lunch and dinner. Fantastic perfectly done dinner with exceptional service. You’d expect to pay a lot more for what you get.

Don’t think twice and if you go, say HI to Jimmy for us! He’s the gentleman who will likely be your waiter and will likely become your friend in no time.

This is a great place, I got to talk to the owner. She is a wonderful lady, they care so much for customers, their foods, and their service. Every single dish on their menu has its characteristic flavor and style, fresh and most importantly, her husband the chef cook, he cooks every single dish with love and care. One minor thing for them to improve is the kitchen exhaust vent, it is a bit smoky inside the restaurant. They need a more powerful kitchen exhaust vent :).
This place is absolutely amazing. A true gem! Service was great and food was so fresh. Loved it!
"We tried Cambodian for the first time and it was very tasty.
The Thai soup was great, the salad fresh and the main course had more food than we could eat, lunch tomorrow 👍
If you are in the area check out the restaurant. The beef was melt on your mouth.  The apple donut for dessert was good."

Great place to take your time to unwind . food is amazin
I am a vegetarian and I have been eating here 2-4 times per month for over a decade. Simply put, this is my favourite restaurant in Drummondville. The food is great and the service is very friendly. I recommend the meal-sized tofu and fried noodle soup. I have a bowl on every visit and it is always delicious.
I love this place. Be careful to order something Vietnamese because they have other Asian dishes that are not well done. Everything Vietnamese is great. Also the imperial roll is out of this world..

Recommended to friends and family, they've all been wholeheartedly satisfied!"
Large bowls of pho tai and bun bo hue for good price compared to other places where prices have increased during pandemic (13$). Place is not too big but not overcrowded.

Delighted to discover this gem in Gatineau! There are a lot of options and the food is pretty affordable. I'm so used to paying so much for restaurants, but the food here while delicious, will not break your wallet. Will be back for sure!

Found Q1 Le Pho Asian Eatery awhile ago but haven’t had a chance to give it a try until recently.  Came on a weekend so it was quite packed.  Waited a few minutes for a table.  Very friendly& speedy service.  Tasty authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  Reasonably priced too.  Wide selections of food.  Parking isn’t a concern as it is located in a huge plaza.  If you haven’t been here, go give it a try!!
This place was pretty good. The food and the service was perfect. There wasn't alot of peoples when i came but we got served amd got our food pretty fast. Their spring roll are the best i ever eaten. It isn't a fancy place but i relly recommend.

"I cannot recommend this place enough.  The food was OUTSTANDING.  One of the best meals I have had this year.  The interior decor might be cafeteria style but the food is world class.  If you are in Estevan, go go go here.

Also the staff were super friendly.  They are the complete dining experience."
"Super welcoming staff even though we didn’t have a reservation. The food was delicious! The chicken broth soup with veggies had a little sweetness but in a good way. The tofu vermicelli  meal was so tasty.
I would recommend a reservation and bringing your own beer or wine."

I never have left a review in my life but seeing all the negative reviews here is surprising , always give something a try for yourself before believing other people opinions"
Great food and good service. I recommend the General Tao with the rice.
The person who owns this restaurant is one of the boat people how arrived in Québec.He was a sargent in the American Army. He had a background in Vietnam as a chef. We have gone many times with friends and on business dinners. Every time it was very tasty and well prepared and hot. If one wants, they can bring their own wine with them. A beautiful Asiatic taste in every fork full. Bond 000 signing out

"Super nice place in Hochelaga, really glad they open a viet restaurant. The food is excellent and the service also.
It is one of the best Pho broth I ever taste. They also sell alcool and cocktail !! Go try it out won't regret"

If you want a big size BanhMi and a competitive price, come here! I can eat it everyday. The bread is crispy, the ingredients inside are perfect! I have been trying many different kind of Banh Mi in MTL. Now, I think this is the BEST👍! I will come back to try BunBo and general Tao!

"Very good pho place. Friendly staffs and clean place.
What I tried :
Pho Dat Biet with Filet Mignon
Grilled Beef served with rice and salad.

The Pho was tasty and hearty. I really liked the broth and it tasted even better with a little bit of Hoisin Sauce and Sriracha. I asked for Filet Mignon instead of the usual beef and even though it tasted good and the meat was soft, I could stick with the usual Pho Dac Biet beef. If you feel fancy, you could totally add the Filet Mignon, but you'll still be satisfied with the usual Pho bowl.

The seasoning on the grilled beef was really amazing! I went during lunch time for there was a possibility to get a combo with the imperial roll (which was amazginly good).

Overall, this place is a nice revamp and it's really worth the try. It's really close to the metro and the Jean-Talon market, where you can take a walk there after your hearty meal. I was happy with my visit :)"
Good quality asian food. Not the typical fried chicken nugget in sweet sauce kind of general tao. Ingrédients are fresh and attention to detail is given in every plate.
Definitely in my top 5 pho places. Service was quick. Portions were good. Spring rolls and wontons were also tasty. My wife says it's some of the best Pad Thai she's had in a long time

A great find for Asian food in Quebec City! My husband and came in to satisfy our Asian food craving and we were so glad we found this place. Food was delicious! We tried the spicy Thai Noodle Soup, beef and veggies rice dish and General Tso’s chicken. Everything was very flavorful and the portions were huge. Friendly service and we had a great experience! Highly recommend!
First time here. Had the chicken pho. Delicious! Perfect balance of grilled fresh chicken, noodles, broth and vegetables…in fact, it was LOADED with chicken and multiple vegetables. I found brocoli, zucchini, bokchoy, carrots, red pepper and yellow pepper with a little onion. So generous compared with other places where you get bland chicken with maybe one piece of broccoli and massive amounts of onion you end up tossing. Well done. I will be a repeat customer. 👏 👌
A place to have a quick lunch. Pho Special Large $17. Great flavor and generous portion!
The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.
This restaurant’s a hidden gem in Humboldt. We ordered the Combo Number 1 for $10.95! Our order came with rice, Chow Mein noodles, deep fried shrimp and sweet and sour ribs. The prices were very affordable. We were well taken care of during our visit and the food was delicious!

Picked up a couple of veggie imperial roll banh mis and veggie bun bo (without the beef) hue. Both were sooooo full of flavour, and probs were ample. The service from the family who ran this place were so warm and friendly. I have another veggie (no roll) banh mi to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. This will be a regular joint when I make my way to the Plateau again...please keep it afloat, locals!
Great fast food style restaurant. The banh mi is tasty and quite large. I usually get a soup too, their new pho style one is great and tasty

New look in 2023 with same food quality and good price
Delicious food and friendly service. Call from 11am to make reservations opens at 5pm. Byob
One of the best pho soups you can have based on the south shore ! Very good
Great experience, employees are funny and professional at the same time and really good food!
Great food, fresh and flavorful. Very reasonable prices and a must visit.
May Deli, a Japanese/Vietnamese restaurant in the city center, tastes very good.  The service is very good.  The sashimi is very tasty,  the fish is thick and large, and it is also very fresh.  The fried shrimp tempura, is absolutely amazing. The shrimp meat is huge and chewy.
"Oh my god this was good.

I am from Vietnam and I can say that this was one of the closest to an authentic taste that I have here in PEI. Had the vermicelli with grilled pork and it was one of the best I ever had.

The owner was nice, I came in, order the food and came out hot, crispy. Ate a bite, and now coming back again for another bowl

If you want some good Vietnamese food, this is the place

Bonus point for the price being very affordable!"

"So lucky I found this gem!

Family owned restaurant and they have a decent amount of tables to dine in!
Love how extensive their menu is and the prices are SUPER reasonable.

Portion size is great especially for the price and the vermicelli was delicious. The spring rolls were a tad on the burnt side but didn’t bother me too much. The grilled pork looked dry but honestly had so much flavour and tasted delicious.

Highly recommend this place for their authentic food."



Great customer service - haven't felt this level of hospitality in a while, was refreshing. The food was amazing quality and hefty proportions. Owner recommended the very spicy sauce, try it - incredibly spicy but worth the dip

Really love this authentic Vietnamese restaurant. We visit very often for take out, lunch and dinner. Price is reasonable. They only do debit/cash. They are quite busy during dinner time but it is worth to wait and try. The spring rolls are crispy juicy and fresh. We love the rice rolls the best and you won’t find this dish from most of the Vietnamese restaurants. The pho is really delicious and full of flavour. Will visit again soon ..
Excellent

"Great Vietnamese restaurant! We tried the Papaya salad, grilled squid, soft-shell crab, the chef choice for the skewers and the fried banana dessert. Everything was delicious and not pricey. The decor and the service were great.

I recommend this restaurant. I will be coming back to try more dishes."

Great vietnamese restaurant. The combo meals are delicious and they have a lot of choices on the menu. I highly recommend the place for dinner with family and friends. You can also bring your own wine.

The bun bo hue flavour is loaded with lemongrass flavour. Small size was reasonable. Service was nice and homey.

"Wow I'm amazed at how good the food is! The staffs are so friendly and the restaurant is really well designed.

I took 3 appetizers :
- Imperial rolls
- Small Pho
- Honey Garlic Chicken skewers.
Guys I am not kidding, it's really really good! I am really picky when it comes to finding a good pho place and I think I found it! The food is high quality, well seasoned and came out fast. The presentation is cute and the prices are perfect. I'm already looking forward to my next meal here."

"I have not been to this restaurant in years as I moved from MTL to TOR. I was down for the weekend and stopped by, unfortunately they weren't opened yet but I had the pleasure of speaking to the lady that worked there, I let her know that I would ALWAYS eat here as a kid growing up and LOVED the food and that I came down from Toronto and she was ready to prep me up some food right then and there despite being closed! I will ALWAYS share this restaurant with my family & friends as not only is the food great but the staff is the BEST!

Thank you for staying Genuine"
Excellent !
