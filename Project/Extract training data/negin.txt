+ Not all wounds will bleed. It's not just bleeding that hurts.
+ I'm so tired when I talk but no one listens, I'm sad but no one understands, I'm lonely but I can't have someone by my side.
+ At a certain age, one can do nothing but silence. Sadness is also silent, joy is also silent.
+ The most hopeless is when you don't know what you want, don't know who you need... The most hopeless is when you know you're longing, but don't know where to look….
+ The more noisy, the more lonely people, the more crowded around us, the more lonely. Because there are souls that no one can touch.
+ I'm sorry about everything, sorry that I couldn't go with you to the beginning of the year. You must find someone more deserving than you.
+ Sorry for not being able to give you a happy and prosperous life, I return you to freedom to have better choices.
+ I'm not worth your sacrifice, I'm so sorry. Thank you for always being by my side. Wish you happy.
+ Indifference is a sharp "knife" that can end all relationships.

+ The coldest thing is not because winter brings snow but the cold heart of the person you always value.

Love will die if there is no trust. Love will end if the two words care no longer exist.

+ My mistake is to give you love. And my mistake would be to lose a lover like you.

+ I would rather choose someone who loves me than the person I love because I can accept that person's love from time to time but I can't stand that person being indifferent to me.

+ My life is silent, empty, indifferent and denied all interest. The world calls me a cold, emotionless person.

+ I never had a chance to step into his world even for a single step. And my world is always open to welcome you in, but you firmly refuse.

+ Many people often appear strong and cold, but in their hearts, they wait and wait for someone's attention.

+ Will start a new life, will be more callous, cold. Care and hope a lot and then receive a lot of disappointment.

+ I don't like people who are cold to me but I like people who love me and are cold to others because of me

+ Goodbye, it's time for me to leave.

+ It's okay for me to be happy, but it's okay for you.

+ I don't miss you, I miss us from the past.

+ This life is boring.

+ Either way, I don't want to live anymore.

+ If only I could be like them.

+ Why is it all about me?

+ You go towards the sun, I go to a life without you.

+ Then the person I love, will people love me?

Well, don't wait any longer, sometimes the sunset still misses the horizon.

+ One-sided people love someone who is heartless, the person who is attached to love loves someone who is heartless.

+ Actually, I was shaken, but I was afraid of losing, so I did not speak.

+ Tell me, why didn't you hold me back then? Why?

+ Learn to be alone, because not everyone stays.

+ We are now strangers, two strangers who know all about each other.

+ What is giving up? Is to see it, still love it, but don't want to bother anymore.

+ I told you not to be sad, I don't want to see you sad. But you never noticed because of whom I was sad.

+ I still can't forget right? But sadly, they forgot about me.

+ He only went with me for a short distance, but I still miss him for a lifetime.

+ When there is no longer a special place in someone's heart, it is best to choose to be silent and leave.

+ Silence! Is the end of a relationship that everyone involved has to understand for themselves.

+ There are people who, right from the moment they like a person, begin to fall in love.

One-sided love is the kind of love that is never rejected or accepted.

+ Using the name of a friend to like a person, not even the qualification to be jealous, the more you like it, the more painful it is.

+ In my heart, there is a person, it is still very difficult to meet, but I always think that I can have "later" with that person.

+ I'm stupid. Always refuse willing hands. Just waiting for a hand that I can't hold for the rest of my life.

+ Some people have never even promised to love you. Originally, in that person's heart, you were just a rainy afternoon, standing together under the same eaves.

+ When he knew me, I didn't know him. When he liked me, I knew him. When he loved me, I liked him. When he left me, I fell in love with him.

+ Just 3 days of no contact, 3 weeks of no contact, 3 months of no contact, it will all be over. The person you want to meet doesn't feel like meeting anymore.

+ I hope you don't tell her our story. Don't give your debts to anyone, because no one deserves these debts.

+ Many people ask me: "Why break up without crying or sad?" I just laughed, so I have to cry in front of everyone to be in love? The saddest person is always the one smiling.

+ He remembers all the minutiae details of his ex. But sadly, I never remember even the smallest details about you. We broke up, hope tomorrow he will truly love the next person.

+ Don't push yourself, girl. If you feel tired, stop and rest for a while. Everything is left there, when you are healthy, do it again.

+ Tears fall, the game is over.

+ Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, and often ends with a tear.

+ Never say you don't love anymore if the other person's tears can still hold you back.

+ No one is worth your tears. And worthy people will never make you cry.

+ Don't draw your love in the heart, but draw it in a circle... so that there is never a beginning and an end.

+ Run after someone who can make you smile because only a smile dispels the dark night in you.

+ The bright future is often based on the forgotten past, you cannot live peacefully if you do not let go of all the past sadness.

+ Love is a knife. It pierces the heart or sometimes it engraves in our hearts miraculous marks and will follow us for the rest of our lives.

Don't lose faith in yourself. Just believe you can do it and you have a reason to try.

+ What to do for a depressed life. Crying for tears to contain chan. Bored to do nothing for the ideal to perish. Stay strong and forget it all…

+ I have no choice

+ I couldn't live any better.

+ I can't change myself

+ I can't get over this problem.

+ I accept to give up everything.

+ Everything is meaningless to me.

+ I can't hold on any longer.

+ I missed the opportunity of my life.

+ It's all their fault, not mine.

+ I am useless.

+ Tell them to do it, I'm superfluous.

+ I don't want to live anymore.

+ Why am I not as lucky as them?

+ Parents don't believe me!

+ I am very disappointed in you!

+ I'm so naughty!

+ I don't deserve the love that you give me!

+ You are a failure of the parents!

+ Why are you so stupid?

+ What kind of drums can people like you do!

+ I have sacrificed everything for you, you must obey!

+ Do you think I'm your servant?

+ You think I'm a money printer?

+ Do you think dad is an idiot?

+ Do you think this house is an inn, and you are just a sommelier?

+ Do you still consider us as your parents?

+ Do you hear? Mommy is talking to you!

Knowing is one thing, doing it again is another!

+ You think I'm a three-year-old kid?

+ What's wrong with you? Is there only dirt in your head?

+ Because of you, my life must be miserable!

+ Knowing that giving birth to a spoiled child like this, I would rather have no children!

+ You are stupid!

+ I don't have a child like you!

+ Why can't you match your brother's fingernails?

+ I'm so ashamed of you!

+ Parents can't teach their children anymore, right?

+ You are not my son, my son has no one as stupid as you!

+ You're so useless.

+ What is the meaning of your life?

+ Do you think that if you whine like this, people will care about you?

+ You are so selfish.

+ Be a little helpful.

+ I am eccentric and different from everyone else.

+ You look like crazy people.

Your family must be very unhappy to have a child like you.

+ You should listen to the adults

+ Who taught you that?

+ You are selfish

+ You're too young to learn this.

+ Hold on now, I forbid you to cry.

+ I know what to ask, even if I say I don't know.

+ I can't help you, I'll solve it myself

+ Look at the people, then look at me.

+ I'm just like my mom/dad

+ Don't listen to what mom/dad says

+ If it weren't for my children, I would have left her/him soon

+ Marrying her/him was the mistake of my life

+ There is no miracle here.

+ I have no dreams.

+ It makes no sense.

+ What's the point of living like this?

+ People only selfishly care about them.

+ This society is disgusting.

+ I can't have the slightest bit of happiness.

+ I'm so lucky to have a friend like you.

+ I think you should give up.

+ Just give up.

+ No matter what you do, the result will not change.

+ That's it, everything is about to end.

+ I'm desperate for everything.

+ There is not a single ray of hope here.

+ What am I working hard for?

+ Take a look at yourself, what have you helped me?

+ I don't know anything, why ask me?

+ I can't get over that person.

+ Is this all really worth it? Doing work like this, in a place like this?

+ There is no benefit in such an effort.

+ This will inevitably lead to failure.

+ Failure is the end of everything.

+ I'm done doing business like this.

+ There is no way to solve this problem.

+ Everything is so bad, I'm going crazy.

+ There is no way

+ "It’s all my fault. It’s my responsibility..."

+ "I don’t see any hope in this situation..."

+ "Even if I survive, I’ll just continue to suffer because of this moment for the rest of my life..."

+ "I can hear someone. It’s the sound of despair. I just can’t stop hearing it…"

+ "There’s no hope left. My mind’s collapsing. Everything’s collapsing..."

+ "We will all sink and perish, devoured by madness..."

+ "I just can’t. I swear I tried to get used to it, BUT I JUST CAN’T."

+ "Please let me out of here. I tried, I really tried. I tried my best. But I just can’t take it anymore!"

+ "Nobody wants to be like this. I don’t want to be like this. I am not here to just be like this."

+ "I will never get out of here..."

+ "We will all eventually become one in the origin."

+ "Collectively losing our sanity is the only redemption we can find here."

+ "You’re the problem. Not me, you!"

+ "So you’re to blame! If it weren’t for you, it wouldn’t have gone this way!"

+ "What do we do here?"

+ "Is there anything we can do in this situation?"

+ "I can’t move my legs..."

+ "I can’t take it..."

+ "I can’t understand"

+ Same shit, different day. We just follow orders.

+ Yeah, it’s all your fault! YOU’RE THE ONE WHO MESSED UP EVERYTHING!

+ You’re the one to blame! Not me! NOT ME!!!

+ I’m not like all these idiots around me! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT WHAT I DO!

+ I hope everything disappears

+ I want to disappear

+ I love you so much, why won’t you visit me

+ Why aren’t you coming to see me?

+ Why won’t you come to me?

+ Why were you there? You should have been with me, not there.

+ For me, this moment is pure hell.
